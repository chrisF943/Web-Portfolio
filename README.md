# Web-Portfolio

Designed a one-page portfolio using HTML, CSS styling, and JavaScript to showcase my skills and projects.
Added elements like light/dark mode toggling, a gradient background, carousel and icon with revealing 
text upon hover. Implemented a contact form using JavaScript to communicate with Formspree and a 
Netlify function.

Hosted on Netlify to take advantage of continuous deployment and function features.
